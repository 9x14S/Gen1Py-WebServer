Flask app file. Run with 'python(3) -m Flask run' after activating the virtual environment.

This program starts a local webserver that enables you to open a Gen 1 Pok√©mon save file, and
    to view or edit it. 
    
This program carries no warranty whatsoever. If you use it, you're responsible for any damages to your 
    save. We can't help you if you mess your save file by doing dumb editions.
    
    Research well before making any editions.
